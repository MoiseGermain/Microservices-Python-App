# 🛠️ DevOps Project: Microservices Python App (Video to Audio Converter)

This project helped me gain hands-on experience deploying a microservices-based application on AWS using Kubernetes. It’s a Python-based system that converts `.mp4` videos into `.mp3` audio files. The app is built using four microservices running in containers, all deployed and managed on **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**.

---

## 🔧 What I Built

This project is made up of the following services:

- **auth-server** – handles user login and JWT authentication
- **converter-module** – picks up `.mp4` files and converts them into `.mp3`
- **notification-server** – sends email notifications with two-factor auth
- **gateway-server** – acts as the API gateway between users and services

I used **RabbitMQ** to pass messages between services, and **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** for data storage.

---

## 🚀 Why I Built This

I wanted to:
- Learn how to deploy and manage **containerized microservices** at scale
- Work with **AWS EKS**, **Helm**, and **Kubernetes manifests**
- Practice securing cloud-native applications using **IAM**, **JWT**, and **Kubernetes secrets**
- Gain experience with messaging systems like **RabbitMQ** and database integration in cloud workloads

## 🧱 Tools & Services I Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **AWS EKS** | Kubernetes hosting |
| **Helm** | Service deployment |
| **kubectl** | Cluster management |
| **Python** | Service logic |
| **RabbitMQ** | Message queueing |
| **PostgreSQL / MongoDB** | Persistent data storage |
| **IAM, Secrets, JWT** | Security & access control |

---

## ⚙️ How I Deployed It (High-Level Flow)

1. **Set up PostgreSQL and MongoDB** for application persistence  
2. **Deployed RabbitMQ** for task queuing between microservices  
3. Created `mp3` and `video` queues in RabbitMQ  
4. Deployed each service (`auth`, `converter`, `gateway`, `notification`) using **Helm charts** and **Kubernetes manifests**  
5. Verified everything was working using:
   ```bash
   kubectl get all

## 📦 How I Built the EKS Cluster

To create the EKS cluster from scratch, I followed these key steps:

- Created IAM roles for the EKS cluster and EKS node group  
- Created the EKS cluster via AWS Console  
- Configured security groups with inbound rules for services  
- Enabled the EBS CSI Addon for persistent volume support  
- Connected to the cluster using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster_name> --region <region>
```

## 📡 API Overview
Once deployed, I tested the system using these endpoints:

🔐 Login
```
POST http://<nodeIP>:30002/login
```
Logs in a user using basic authentication and returns a JWT token.

## 📤 Upload a Video
```
POST http://<nodeIP>:30002/upload
```
Uploads an .mp4 video file and initiates the conversion process.

## 📥 Download the Audio
```
GET http://<nodeIP>:30002/download?fid=<file_id>
```
Downloads the converted .mp3 file using the file identifier.

## 🔒 Email Notifications & 2FA

To enable email-based 2FA for this application, I followed these steps:

1. I generated an **app-specific password** from my Gmail account under the "Security" settings  
2. I stored this password securely in the Kubernetes `secret.yaml` file under the `notification-server` microservice  
3. This allowed the app to authenticate with Gmail and send **2FA verification emails** to users during login

All sensitive credentials were handled securely using Kubernetes Secrets to avoid hardcoding any sensitive data into the manifests or application code.

## 🧼 How I Destroyed the Infrastructure

Once testing was complete, I cleaned up all the cloud resources to avoid ongoing AWS charges:

1. I deleted the **EKS Node Group** from the AWS Console  
2. Then I deleted the **EKS Cluster** itself  

This ensured that no compute, networking, or storage resources remained active after the project was completed.

## ✅ What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Building and deploying **multi-service applications** on AWS using Kubernetes  
- Using **Helm**, `kubectl`, and managing **IAM roles and AWS networking** for secure infrastructure  
- Understanding the power of **microservices and asynchronous communication** via RabbitMQ  
- Securing cloud-native applications with **JWT**, **Kubernetes Secrets**, and **IAM-based access control**
